# iFunny-Chat-Bot-Template
A simple template for an iFunny chat bot written in Python. Requires Python 3.8 or higher

You will need to edit iFunnyClient.py:
- enter email and password
- generate basic auth token
- get bearer from login

libs.iFunny.py is the main part of the bot.
libs.commands.py is where you can put your commands. (I have a really good setup for commands in there)

The rest is for you to figure out but I will give you this:
